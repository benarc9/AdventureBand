# AdventureBand
Roguelike that takes inspiration from angband.

Written completely in Lua and makes use of the Love2D engine. All of the roguelike framework is completely original and makes no use of pre-existing roguelike boilerplate code or frameworks other then Love2D which provides rendering and game loop.

# State
I stopped working on this project in order to focus on college so it remains unfinished. Also, you may have a tough time getting it up and running due my failed attempt to implement a entity-component based architecture before I was completely familiar with that type of system.
